    <h2>1. Scope of MNTR Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
                1.1 The MNTR Platform is an online marketplace designed to allow registered users ("Members") to offer services (Known as "Lessons") directly to other Members. 
                Members offering Lessons are known as "Mentors" while Members partaking in lessons are known as "Students". Lessons generally include the Mentor mentoring, teaching, 
                or advising the given Student or Student/s on a pre-defined topic as described in the Lesson prior to booking, and may be provided at their own residence or a 
                place of their choosing, at a time of their choosing.
        </li>
        <li>
                1.2 As the provider of the MNTR Platform, SUNFALL does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, 
                deliver, or supply any Lessons, nor is SUNFALL an organiser of educational material. Mentors alone are responsible for 
                their Lessons and Mentoring Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly
                with each other. SUNFALL is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between
                Members. SUNFALL is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member.
        </li>
        <li>
                1.3 Although SUNFALL may attempt to peacefully intervene and/or mediate any disputes between Members, it does so at it's own discretion. 
                SUNFALL makes no claim and has no control over, and makes no guarantee as to (i) the educational value, quality, safety, suitability or 
                legality of any Lessons or Mentoring Services, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Lesson descriptions, ratings or reviews or other Member content, 
                or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member (Be that Mentor or Student). Positive ratings displayed should not be construed as an 
                endorsement by SUNFALL. You should always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to book a Lesson, accept a booking request 
                from a Student, or communicate and interact with other Members, whether online or in person. Any user profile images are not confirmed by 
                SUNFALL and should be treated with some caution.
        </li>
        <li>
                1.4 If you choose to use the MNTR Platform as a Mentor, your relationship with SUNFALL is limited to being an independent, 
                third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of SUNFALL for any reason, and you act 
                exclusively on your own behalf and of your own volition.
        </li>
        <li>
                1.5 SUNFALL may use Member Content in promotional and marketing material dispersed through any forms of media as deemed 
                appropriate at the time, including but not limited to new media (websites, marketing emails, online videos) and 
                traditional media (billboards, magazines, newspapers).
        </li>
        <li>
                1.6 SUNFALL cannot and does not offer any guarantees in regards to service availability in any region or regions.

            8.3 You are solely responsible for setting a price for your Lesson (“Lesson Cost”). Once a Student

        </li>
        
        <li>
            8.4 You may not attempt to game the system by accepting bookings at the last minute in the hope 
            that Students will be unable to show up after securing the Initial Deposit. SUNFALL reserves the 
            right to punish users found infringing upon any as of yet unknown exploits or vulnerabilities in 
            the MNTR Platform or booking system.

        <li>
            8.5 Any terms and conditions included in your Lesson, in particular in relation to cancellations, 
            must not conflict with these Terms or the relevant cancellation policy for your Lesson.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            8.6 The placement of Lessons in search results or elsewhere on the MNTR Platform will vary based 
            on a variety of search parameters and factors, including but not limited to keywords, location, 
            ratings, availability, cost. SUNFALL reserves the right to modify these algorithms at any time.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            8.7 When you accept a booking request by a Student, you are entering into a legally binding agreement 
            with the Student and are required to provide your Mentor Service(s) to the Student as described in 
            your Lesson when the booking request is made. You also agree to pay the applicable Mentor Fee and 
            any applicable Taxes. As a Mentor you are solely responsible for determining your obligations to report, 
            collect, remit or include in your Lesson Fees any applicable GST, VAT or other indirect sales taxes ("Taxes").

            8.8 SUNFALL recommends that Mentors obtain appropriate insurance for their Mentor Services but makes 
            no claim as to whether or not that is required by law in any given area.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            8.9 SUNFALL requires Mentors to act with integrity and excellence at all times. Any suggestions 
            of lewd, vulgar, explicit or otherwise harmful behaviour by any Students, whether through email, 
            messages or ratings are ground for immediate termination from the MNTR Platform 
            (notwithstanding any other legal ramifications).
        </li>
        
        <li>
            8.10 Tax regulations may require us to collect appropriate Tax information from Mentors, 
            or to withhold Taxes from payouts to Mentors, or both. If a Mentor fails to provide us with 
            the required documentation under applicable law (e.g., a tax number) that we determine to be 
            sufficient to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we reserve 
            the right to withhold payouts up to the tax-relevant amount as required by law, until resolution.

        <li>
            9.1 Subject to meeting any requirements (such as completing any verification processes) set by 
            SUNFALL, you can book a Lesson available on the MNTR Platform by following the respective 
            booking process. All applicable fees, including the Lesson Cost, Platform Fee and any applicable
            Taxes (collectively, “Total Fees”) will be presented to you prior to booking a Lesson.
        </li> 
        
        <li>
            9.2 Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from SUNFALL, a legally binding agreement is 
            formed between you and the Mentor. Stripe will collect the Initial Deposit at time of 
            acceptance and the remainder at the conclusion of the lesson.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            9.3 You should carefully review all lesson descriptions and 'requirements' that you intend 
            to book to ensure that you (or any additional students you are booking for) meet the 
            eligibility criteria and any listed 'hardware' requirements (e.g. photography equipment, 
            music equipment, necessary articles of clothing etc). You may, at your own discretion, 
            inform the Mentor of any medical or physical conditions which you think may impact your 
            ability to participate in the Lesson. You are responsible for identifying and complying
             with any and all laws, rules and regulations that may apply to you during your participation in the Lesson.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            9.4 Lessons are intended to be attended solely by those Students as specified in the 
            original booking, and no additional students may be present.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            9.5 You agree that a Mentor may decline your lesson request for any reason whatsoever, 
            and has no obligation to provide you with a reason as to why your booking request was 
            declined, and has no obligation to accept your booking request in the future.

    <h2>10. Lesson Cancellations, Rescheduling and Refunds</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            10.1 Students can cancel a booking at any time prior to the booking being Accepted by the Mentor
             and no fee's will be imposed. After this, students can cancel a booking but are required to contact
              SUNFALL customer service to do so, and may incur some fees (such as the platform fee and 
              Stripe fees not being refunded).
        </li>
        
        <li>
            10.2 If a Mentor cancels a confirmed booking, the Student will receive a full refund of the Total
             Fees for such booking minus the Platform Fee. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            10.3 Any lesson that would be (i) negatively affected by a natural phenomena (Such as rain, 
            thunderstorms, flooding, earthquakes) or (ii) be affected by situations or conditions that would 
            prevent the Mentor from offering the Lesson in safety may be rescheduled by the Mentor or Student without fee.
        </li> 
        
        <li>
            10.4 In certain circumstances, SUNFALL may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessary to 
            cancel a pending or confirmed booking and initiate corresponding refunds and payouts. This may be 
            where SUNFALL believes in good faith this is necessary to avoid significant harm to SUNFALL, the 
            MNTR Platform, other Members, third parties or property, or (ii) for any of the reasons set out in these Terms.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            10.5 If a Student or SUNFALL cancels a confirmed booking, and the Student receives a refund in 
            accordance with the Student Refund Policy, after the Mentor has already been paid, Stripe will be 
            entitled to recover the amount of any such refund from the Mentor, including by subtracting such 
            refund amount out from any future Payouts due to the Mentor.

<div>
    <h2>11. Ratings and Reviews</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            11.1  Students can leave a public review ("Review") and star rating ("Rating") of both the Lesson and 
            Mentor. Lesson reviews should reflect the opinion of the student in regards to the quality, expertise, 
            content, instructional aids, feedback and any other quality deemed relevant of said Lesson. Mentor 
            reviews should reflect the opinion of the student in regards to the overall attitude, friendliness, 
            punctuality and any other quality deemed relevant of said Mentor, but not overlap those already 
            covered in the lesson review. Ratings or Reviews reflect the opinions of individual Members and do 
            not reflect the opinion of SUNFALL. Ratings and Reviews are not verified by SUNFALL for accuracy 
            and may be incorrect or misleading.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            11.2 Ratings and Reviews by Students and Mentors must be accurate and may not contain any offensive or 
            defamatory language. Ratings and Reviews are subject to Section 6 and Section 13 and not be extortionate in any manner.
        </li>
        
        <li>11.3 Members are prohibited from manipulating or 'gaming' the Ratings and Reviews system in any manner.</li>
        
        <li>
            11.4 Ratings and Reviews are part of a Member’s public profile and may also be surfaced elsewhere on 
            the MNTR Platform (such as the Lesson page) together with other relevant information such as number of
             bookings, average acceptance, response time, and more.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            11.5 Ratings and Reviews are an integral functionality of the MNTR Platform, and all users are 
            encouraged to leave ratings after the conclusion of a lesson. Repeated failure to leave ratings may
             result in certain negative adjustments including but not limited to (i) Mentors being informed 
             that you repeatedly failed to leave ratings and reviews.
