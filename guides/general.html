    <!-- Mission: To foster the spirit of learning from your fellow man.
    
    Why are you doing this?
    A wise man once extolled to me the virtues of the mentoring systems of old, and made me realize that 
    the institution of mentoring had been widely replaced by more centralized education systems in 
    todays society. While there are huge positives to such a centralized system, it could be said that 
    it has become increasingly problematic in recent times. Soaring costs, lack of personalized teaching, 
    lack of connection between student and teacher, and even lack of relevance are all things that can be 
    attributed to the modern system of education.
    
    MNTR aims to democratize societies ability to teach others and learn subjects that they find interesting and relevant to them.

    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">How do I create an account?</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            After you install MNTR you will be prompted to create an account. For this we'll need your 
            email, password, and first and last name. You will receive a verification email 
            (check your spam folder if you do not receive it). You must verify your email address before 
            you can book a lesson. You can skip creating an account if you wish. You can always create 
            an account later by going to the profile page and following the prompts.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">How do I book a lesson?</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            After you have created and verified your account, you can use the search feature to find lessons 
            in your area. Simply tap a lesson that interests you. You'll then be taken to the Lessons 
            page where you'll be able to view a description of the lesson, see prices and distance from you, 
            and also read past reviews from other students. If you like what you see, hit the 'BOOK LESSON' 
            button at the bottom of the screen. You'll then we taken to the Booking page. From here, you 
            should select a day that suits you, and an available time for that day*.  You'll then be taken 
            to the Confirm Booking page. Here you can leave an initial comment or greeting (recommended!). 
            If this is your first lesson, you'll be asked to enter your payment details. If you have booked a 
            lesson in the past, you will be presented with your saved card to make booking faster. IMPORTANT: 
            You will not be charged unless the Mentor accepts your booking, at which point  20% of the total + 
            platform fee will be deducted from your account. The remainder will be  deducted from your account 
            after the lesson successfully finishes. Once you have confirmed your booking, a <i>Contract</i> will 
            be created for the specified lesson and time. The mentor will be informed, and has the ability 
            to accept or decline your lesson. Before the Mentor has accepted or canceled, you may also 
            cancel the contract. You may not cancel if a Mentor has already accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            * Note: You cannot book a time slot that is less than 3 hours away. This ensures both the Mentor and 
            Student are able to show up on time in the event a lesson is accepted.
        </p>
   </div>
    
    
    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">How do I contact the Mentor?</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            For safety, and to minimize hassle to Mentors, you can only contact a Mentor if you have an active booking 
            with them. If a Mentor decides to accept your lesson, you will be able to text them directly in the app 
            from the contract page. You may, at your own discretion, share your contact details with the Mentor. 
            Discussion about circumventing  the platforms fees via making payments outside of the MNTR platform or 
            about booking future lessons outside of MNTR are prohibited and may result in a permanent ban for both parties.

    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">What do I do when its time to start the lesson?</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Once it is close to the designated start time and you have met with your Mentor, open up the app and go to the 
            contracts page. Scroll to the bottom of the conversation and there will be a "START LESSON" button. As the 
            student, you must initiate the start of the lesson. Once you have done so, the Mentor will be presented with 
            a "START LESSON" button as well. You must wait for the Mentor to click this button also before starting. After 
            the Mentor has pressed "START LESSON" you will be notified and a "FINISH LESSON" button will appear. 
            DO NOT CLICK THIS YET. This button is for when a lesson has concluded.
        </p>
   </div>
    
   
    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">What do I do once the lesson is finished?</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            After the lesson has finished, you may click the "FINISH LESSON" button. As with starting a lesson, the 
            student must initiate this action. Once the student has done so, the Mentor will be able to click 
            "FINISH LESSON" also. At this point, we will attempt to transfer money from your account to the 
            Mentors. If there are any problems with the final payment, you and the Mentor will be notified, 
            as well as a representative of MNTR. If this happens, don't worry - chances are it's a simple mistake 
            and we'll be able to get it sorted as soon as possible. Contact support@getmntr.com at your leisure 
            and we'll guide you through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a lesson is concluded you will also be able to leave a review. Remember to differentiate your review
            between the Mentor themselves as a person, and the lesson they provided. It is entirely possible to give
            them a high score in the 'Review Mentor' section, and a moderate or low score in the 'Review Lesson' 
            section (or vice-versa). Above all, please be fair.  If you wish to report any sort of abuse, please 
            make sure you have left the lesson safely and then contact support@getmntr.com.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">A payment failed! Help!</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            If an initial deposit fails, both yourself and the Mentor will be informed and the booking automatically 
            canceled. This usually happens if there is a problem with your card details or potentially the Mentors 
            bank account details. If you suspect it is a problem with your card, you may attempt to book the lesson 
            again. Hit the red '-' button next to your saved payment option and you will be able to re-enter your 
            cards details. If you face more problems we suggest using a different card or contacting your bank. 
            You may also contact support@getmntr.com and we can try to guide you through it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a final payment fails after a lesson concludes, the lesson will conclude regardless and both the Student
            and Mentor should part ways amicably. This is uncommon, but there are ways MNTR can help. 
            Contact support@getmntr.com and we'll guide you through it.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <h3 class="collapsible m-0">What are the platform fees and costs involved?</h3>
        <div class="content">
        <p>MNTR aims to be fair and transparent in its fee structure. The fees listed below are correct as of 23/03/2019.</p> 
        
        <h4>Student Pays: (Lesson Cost + Booking Fee)</h4>
        <p>
            The booking fee is $2 of the applicable currency. For a lesson that costs $25, the Student will be required to pay $27 in total. 
            The $2 platform fee is included entirely in the initial deposit, and is non-refundable in the event of a 
            cancellation made after a booking has been accepted.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Mentor Earns: Lesson Cost MINUS (Stripe Fees PLUS Platform Fees)</h4>
        
        <p>
            The stripe fee is 30c + (1.75% to 2.9%). Since MNTR takes an initial deposit and a final payment, the static 30c fee 
            is applied twice. Therefore, the stripe total is fee is (60c + 1.75% to 2.9%). The Platform fee is 6% of the lesson cost.
            This makes the effective fee percentage around 10% for the average lesson cost.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I.e. For a lesson with a cost of $25, the Mentor should expect to get approximately $22.50. </br>
            For a lesson with a cost of $40, the Mentor should expect to get approximately $36.30.

            After you install MNTR you will be prompted to create an account. For this we'll need your 
            email, password, and first and last name. You will receive a verification email 
            (check your spam folder if you do not receive it). You must verify your email address before 
            you can become a Mentor. Once you have done this, head to the profile page. Towards the bottom will 
            be a large blue button with the text "BECOME A MENTOR". Tap this and you will be taken to the mentor onboarding
            page.
        </p>

        <p>
            To become a mentor we require additional information from you, which can vary depending on your location.
            This is part of the "Know Your Customer" information required by Stripe, the payment processing platform
            used by MNTR.
            We also need your payment details, so that when a student books a lesson with you, you can be paid
            directly into your bank account. After you've entered the necessary data, hit the confirmation button 
            at the bottom of the page. If all your details are correct, you'll be taken to the Add Lesson Page where
            you can create your first lesson (See the relevant section of this guide below for more info on that). After 
            you have uploaded your first lesson you will be taken to the availability page where you can set when you are
            available (ASee the relevant section of this guide below for more info on that). If this process gets interrupted
            at any point you can always return to the profile section of the app where you will be able to adjust your 
            current offered lessons and availability.

            Clicking the 'Lessons' button will take you to your lessons page where you can view all lessons you currently
            offer. Click the lesson you wish to edit. This will take you to that lessons page (This is what anyone else who looks at
            your lesson sees also). If you wish to edit this, click the edit button at the top right with the 3 dots.
            This will take you to the same page you used to create the lesson. You can edit any of the information needed here. 
            When you're finished editing, scroll to the bottom and click the blue 'update' button. Alternatively, if you wish to not
            offer this lesson anymore, you may delete the lesson. A lesson can only be deleted if you have no current contracts 
            for that particular lesson.

        </p>
        <p>
            If you wish, you may delete all availabilities. This can be used if you are going on holidays for instance or
