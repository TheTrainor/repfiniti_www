The goal of the NN is to analyze workout data, in aggregate, across all users of Repfiniti so as to be able to generate workouts tailored towards people with similar backgrounds and fitness ability.
	</p>

            <li class="block-li">To provide online backup and sync ability for member workout data</li>
        </ul>
        
    <p>
        REPFINITI utilizes 'Google Firebase' to collect statistics on app usage. These statistics are used by SUNFALL to see what features of the app are the most popular and get a feel for what our users like, which countries Repfiniti is most popular in, and various other things.
    </p>
		
	<p>
		Sunfall may note and store details of your hardware setup, including but not limited to web browser, operating 
		system, device, and any other software or hardware attributes deemed necessary to improve the REPFINITI Platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>Although Sunfall is an Australian business, our data centres can be located in multiple locations across the Americas, Europe and Asia.</p>
	
	<p>
		Your contact information may also be used for accounting, invoicing and billing purposes, marketing purposes, by 
		third party service providers to Sunfall, and to respond to any enquiry you make, in some cases information we 
		collect is transferred overseas. When you contact Sunfall, We may keep a record of the communication(s) 
		between you and Sunfall to help resolve any issues you might have.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>2. Payments</h2>
	
	<p>
		All payment processing facilities are provided by either GOOGLE or APPLE depending upon your device. We also rely on RevenueCat to simplify our In-AppPurchases and help track conversions. As such, you are bound by the Terms set out by them in usage of their platform.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>3. Cookies</h2>
	
	<p>
		Cookies may be used by the REPFINITI Platform website (www.repfiniti.com) for the purpose of storing your preferences 
		and to enable analysis of the REPFINITI Platforms user base (i.e. number of users, number of users from specific countries and so on).
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>4. Protecting your Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		All information sent between the REPFINITI Platform client apps and web servers is encrypted with TLS. 
		Your account is protected by a password of your own choosing. 
		Only the hashed (encrypted) form of your password is stored on our servers. We take all reasonable steps to 
		ensure protection of your data, but cannot guarantee absolute security of our systems, or that we will not 
		be the target of malicious hackers or viruses. In light of this, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the 
		security or privacy of your personal information. You transmit your personal details to us at your own risk.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You are encouraged to use strong passwords that are unique to the REPFINITI Platform (not shared with any other 
		service you may use). If you have trouble remembering or creating strong passwords, there are a variety 
		of secure, third party password managers available to assist you, including LastPass, KeePass, 1Password and Dashlane.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>5. Third Parties</h2>
	
	<p>
		The REPFINITI Platform relies on a number of third parties and their API's (Application Programming Interfaces) to operate. 
		These include but are not limited to DigitalOcean, Google, and SendGrid. Sunfall provides 
		these companies only with the minimum information needed to operate the REPFINITI Platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall cannot be held responsible for, and does not accept responsibility or liability for, the 
		privacy policy of any of these third parties.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you wish to know more about how your information is used by any of these third parties you may contact 
		us at support@repfiniti.com or through any other means of contact with Sunfall or the REPFINITI Platform.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>6. Marketing</h2>
	
	<p>
		From time to time, Sunfall may run advertising campaigns through third parties, including but not limited to 
		Instagram, Facebook or Google Adwords. These networks allow users to opt-out of these advertising campaigns 
		if the advertisements are of no interest to them. These third parties may use cookies and other web technologies 
		to track your movement around the internet, regardless of whether Sunfall is running a current campaign or 
		not. There are several technologies available, including ad-blockers, if you wish to disallow this type of 
		tracking by third parties as you browse the internet.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>7. Communications</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall reserves the right to send you administrative and account-related messages that are vital to the functionality 
		of the REPFINITI Platform and thus cannot be opted out of. To cease this communication from Sunfall or the REPFINITI Platform you must terminate your account. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you believe the amount of account-related messages you receive is excessive and do not wish to terminate 
		your account, please contact customer support with your feedback, as we are always looking to improve our services.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is possible that emails sent to you will arrive in your spam folder. in these circumstances, using 
		whatever means your email provider allows you, you should mark the message as 'not spam' and/or 'important'. 
		This will hopefully prevent future emails from Sunfall or the REPFINITI Platform from appearing in your spam folder.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>8. Access to and Modification of Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall will allow you at all times to access, edit or delete information that you have made available to Us or 
		the Members of the REPFINITI Platform, unless we are legally required to hold such information about you 
		(for instance, in the case of a court order or injunction).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you wish to access or modify personal information you believe we may have about you which is not readily available to you 
		through the REPFINITI Platform, you may contact us directly and request a raw copy of your information. We may deny 
		this request if it involves developing entirely new systems or is deemed unreasonably repetitive, except where required by law.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>9. Bug Bounties</h2>
	
	<p>
		While Sunfall has no official bug bounty programs in place, all users are encouraged to submit bug reports 
		directly to customer service, where we may, at our sole discretion, implement fixes. Discovery of 
		particularly egregious bugs may not result in monetary reward, but will undoubtedly gain Sunfalls immense 
		respect and admiration. If you wish to discuss possible bug bounties, contact us through our customer service email.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>10. Privacy Concerns</h2>
	
	<p>
		If you have any concerns about how We handle your personal information or require further information, 
		please email Sunfall through our customer service email. We will endeavour to reply to you as 
		soon as possible to alleviate any of your concerns.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Sunfall will notify all registered users 
		about any changes to this policy and update the website and all related material. Please check your registered email regularly (including your spam folder!).
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>11. Updates to Privacy Policy</h2>
	
	<p>
		REPFINITI is constantly in development, and features or policies may change in the future. By downloading the REPFINITI app or using the service, you are consenting to the possibility and automatic acceptance of future policy changes without being explicitly informed.
