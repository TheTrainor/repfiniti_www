	<h1>MNTR Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Last Updated 13 March, 2019</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>
		Sunfall (ABN 41425801597) ("Sunfall", "We" or "Us", makers of the MNTR Platform) manages the information that We 
		collect from you in accordance with all applicable privacy legislation in Australia and all countries in which the MNTR Platform operates.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy describes how Sunfall handles your personal information, and sets out the rights 
		and obligations that both you and Sunfall have in relation to your personal information.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		By accessing www.getmntr.com (the "Site") you accept and agree to the terms and conditions of the MNTR Platforms <a href="https://getmntr.com/terms">Terms 
		of Service</a> ("Terms of Service"), which includes your consent to, and authorization of, the collection, use and 
		disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Note that under the MNTR Platforms terms 
		and conditions of use, you must not use the Site if you are under 18 years of age.
	</p>
</div>


<div>
	<h2>1. Collection and Use of Your Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall provides a unique platform to enable the ease and acceleration of in-person learning and teaching opportunities 
		to those who may otherwise be unable to establish themselves in the private education and mentoring space ("MNTR Platform").
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To provide functionality required by the MNTR Platform, you are required to provide certain personal information. 
		A basic Member account is required to provide, but is not limited to, your email address, first and last names, 
		and a password. Members wishing to Mentor will be required to provide more details about themselves. This may 
		vary by region and country, and can include, but is not limited to, your phone number, date of birth, bank account 
		details, address and government ID. Members wishing to participate in Lessons will be required to provide debit 
		or credit card details in order to pay for the Lesson.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		With the exception of Banking Details and Card information (as described in Section 2. Payments), all information 
		submitted by Members is available to Us for use in enabling the proper functionality of the MNTR Platform and 
		for ensuring all Members act in good faith (including Ratings and Reviews, Lesson Details, Contracts and Contract 
		Events). All necessary details regarding your specified Lessons, Availabilities and general information (First 
		and Last name) is also available to other Members of the MNTR Platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>Sunfall collects this data from you to facilitate the following functionality from the MNTR Platform:</p>
	
		<ul class='block'>
			<li class="block-li">Account creation, identification and authentication</li>
			<li class="block-li">To enable the creation and publishing of Lessons on the MNTR Platform</li>
			<li class="block-li">To enable the creation of Contracts between Students and Mentors for mentoring</li>
			<li class="block-li">To provide and improve our services</li>
			<li class="block-li">To ensure that Sunfall and its Members receive payment for their services where applicable</li>
			<li class="block-li">To contact you</li>
			<li class="block-li">On an aggregate basis to help us understand our customers and grow our userbase</li>
			<li class="block-li">To provide or arrange for internal or external verification services</li>
			<li class="block-li">To provide or arrange for external payment services</li>
		</ul>
		
	<p>
		Sunfall endeavours to ensure that any sensitive information of yours is not shared to other Members, including but 
		not limited to your email address and home address. We suggest that Mentors always meet their students in 
		a public space prior to a lesson (until the Members are known to each other) and to not list their exact address 
		when putting Lessons online. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Your location can be, at your choosing, collected at multiple points in the app to facilitate creating or searching 
		for lessons. In the instance of creating a lesson, your exact location at that point in time is never shared with any other Members, and 
		is always offset randomly by several hundred meters. You can optionally specify to share your accurate lesson location (For instance, 
		if you have a dedicated meeting spot such as a studio or cafe) with potential Students to enable them to get accurate directions to 
		the specified location.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When starting a lesson, a Students location is required to be collected. Seconds later this is then compared to the 
		Mentors location (accounting for some accuracy errors), and the lesson is started if both Student and Mentor are 
		deemed to have met (This method is in place to reduce likelihood of disputes). After location is determined, the 
		distance of the Student and Mentor is saved within our database - actual location at time of the lesson is then 
		erased and is not viewable by anyone at Sunfall.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall will never use information of yours that is not already freely public on the MNTR Platform in any marketing 
		or promotional material, however we may use anonymous aggregated data from our users in this instance.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Your user ID, Lessons, Ratings and Reviews, and other related material are all publicly available from within the 
		app or from the MNTR Site. We advise you to use discretion and be cautious when posting. Sunfall in no way accepts 
		responsibility for information you disclose and is voluntarily posted by you in any accessible area of the MNTR 
		Platform Site or Apps.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall may note and store details of your hardware setup, including but not limited to web browser, operating 
		system, device, and any other software or hardware attributes deemed necessary to improve the MNTR Platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>Although Sunfall is an Australian business, our data centres can be located in multiple locations across the Americas, Europe and Asia.</p>
	
	<p>
		Your contact information may also be used for accounting, invoicing and billing purposes, marketing purposes, by 
		third party service providers to Sunfall, and to respond to any enquiry you make, in some cases information we 
		collect is transferred overseas. When you contact Sunfall, We may keep a record of the communication(s) 
		between you and Sunfall to help resolve any issues you might have.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>2. Payments</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall and the MNTR Platform uses Stripe to provide payment processing (as set out in the Terms of Service). 
		Sunfall is required to provide certain details to Stripe, including your personal information, banking details, 
		and card details to enable payment or payout functionality. AT NO POINT IN TIME IS ANY SENSITIVE BANKING OR 
		DEBIT CARD DETAILS STORED ON SUNFALL SERVERS OR THE MNTR PLATFORM. Instead, information is sent directly 
		from the users device to Stripe servers, who supply a secure Token in return. This token can then be used 
		by the MNTR Platform to initiate payments and payouts on users behalf.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>3. Cookies</h2>
	
	<p>
		Cookies may be used by the MNTR Platform website (www.getmntr.com) for the purpose of storing your preferences 
		and to enable analysis of the MNTR Platforms user base (i.e. number of users, number of users from specific countries and so on).
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>4. Protecting your Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		All information sent between the MNTR Platform client apps and web servers is encrypted with TLS. 
		Your account is protected by a password of your own choosing. 
		Only the hashed (encrypted) form of your password is stored on our servers. We take all reasonable steps to 
		ensure protection of your data, but cannot guarantee absolute security of our systems, or that we will not 
		be the target of malicious hackers or viruses. In light of this, we cannot and do not ensure or warrant the 
		security or privacy of your personal information. You transmit your personal details to us at your own risk.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		You are encouraged to use strong passwords that are unique to the MNTR Platform (not shared with any other 
		service you may use). If you have trouble remembering or creating strong passwords, there are a variety 
		of secure, third party password managers available to assist you, including LastPass, KeePass, 1Password and Dashlane.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>5. Third Parties</h2>
	
	<p>
		The MNTR Platform relies on a number of third parties and their API's (Application Programming Interfaces) to operate. 
		These include but are not limited to Stripe, Amazon, DigitalOcean, Google, SendGrid and MongoDB. Sunfall provides 
		these companies only with the minimum information needed to operate the MNTR Platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall cannot be held responsible for, and does not accept responsibility or liability for, the 
		privacy policy of any of these third parties.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you wish to know more about how your information is used by any of these third parties you may contact 
		us at support@getmntr.com or through any other means of contact with Sunfall or the MNTR Platform.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>6. Marketing</h2>
	
	<p>
		From time to time, Sunfall may run advertising campaigns through third parties, including but not limited to 
		Instagram, Facebook or Google Adwords. These networks allow users to opt-out of these advertising campaigns 
		if the advertisements are of no interest to them. These third parties may use cookies and other web technologies 
		to track your movement around the internet, regardless of whether Sunfall is running a current campaign or 
		not. There are several technologies available, including ad-blockers, if you wish to disallow this type of 
		tracking by third parties as you browse the internet.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>7. Communications</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall reserves the right to send you administrative and account-related messages that are vital to the functionality 
		of the MNTR Platform and thus cannot be opted out of. To cease this communication from Sunfall or the MNTR Platform you must terminate your account. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you believe the amount of account-related messages you receive is excessive and do not wish to terminate 
		your account, please contact customer support with your feedback, as we are always looking to improve our services.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		It is possible that emails sent to you will arrive in your spam folder. in these circumstances, using 
		whatever means your email provider allows you, you should mark the message as 'not spam' and/or 'important'. 
		This will hopefully prevent future emails from Sunfall or the MNTR Platform from appearing in your spam folder.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>8. Access to and Modification of Personal Information</h2>
	
	<p>
		Sunfall will allow you at all times to access, edit or delete information that you have made available to Us or 
		the Members of the MNTR Platform, unless we are legally required to hold such information about you 
		(for instance, in the case of a court order or injunction).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If you wish to access or modify personal information you believe we may have about you which is not readily available to you 
		through the MNTR Platform, you may contact us directly and request a raw copy of your information. We may deny 
		this request if it involves developing entirely new systems or is deemed unreasonably repetitive, except where required by law.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>9. Bug Bounties</h2>
	
	<p>
		While Sunfall has no official bug bounty programs in place, all users are encouraged to submit bug reports 
		directly to customer service, where we may, at our sole discretion, implement fixes. Discovery of 
		particularly egregious bugs may not result in monetary reward, but will undoubtedly gain Sunfalls immense 
		respect and admiration. If you wish to discuss possible bug bounties, contact us through our customer service email.
	</p>
</div>

<div>
	<h2>10. Privacy Concerns</h2>
	
	<p>
		If you have any concerns about how We handle your personal information or require further information, 
		please email Sunfall through our customer service email. We will endeavour to reply to you as 
		soon as possible to alleviate any of your concerns.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. Sunfall will notify all registered users 
		about any changes to this policy and update the website and all related material. Please check your registered email regularly (including your spam folder!).
